## About the project
The initial design of this page was very confusing and user-unfriendly. So I made a complete redesign resulting in the page being much more attractive and easy to follow for the users. After having the design ready, the development itself was very straightforward. Was done completely for free, just as a support of the cause. The production version can be found on https://urad.pirati.cz/
