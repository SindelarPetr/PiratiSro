## About the project
Initial design of this page was very confusing and user unfriendly. So I made a complete redesign resulting in the page being much more attractive and easy to follow for the users. After having the design ready, the development itself was very straightforward. Was done completely for free, just as a support of the cause. The production version can be found on https://urad.pirati.cz/

I am a .NET Lead Senior Developer I have worked for couple of major Czech software companies. Programming is my passion since I was 13. This project was at that time one of my first large projects ever made (at the age of 17).
